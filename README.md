# Welcome to WebSinu-Scraper

I decided to add the project to github so it would be open to anyone. In order to make it work, you only have to replace username and password with your own. 

I think it is adaptable to other project (for example I embedded it into an [express server](https://sinu2.herokuapp.com/)) 

Have fun with it!
